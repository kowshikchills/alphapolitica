It is believed that they do not have the authority, they have only crores of discretionary powers, should further investigation be done on it, changing the chart seat is not all Asha changed six, so whatever happened here, as for CBI chart sheet and second chart sheet, what role was given by Avinash, the evidences were incorporated by the CBI.

Whenever the names appeared in the charge sheet, YS Vivekananda Reddy expressed suspicions that the end was imminent, adding that Avinashreddy had a key role.After the murder, they did not pay any attention to the fact that the blood stain should be strengthened or CI Shankar should call and tell the police about the heart attack. This happened in February and all this was the target of the CBI and then Sunitha Reddy. Her fight was really her fight to know that she had killed her father and get punished. Yas Rajasekhar Reddy died in a helicopter accident. At that time, Sonia Gandhi did various campaigns that the ruling party channel was Reliance. However, it is not known whether it is true or not. Jaganmohan's father said that those who were told by Jaganmohan's father should be brought to justice. Let's take a look, even though he is a brother, he wrote a letter as Sunitha Reddy and there Aagkumvida also approached the Supreme Court. She should definitely appreciate the situation in this matter. It is in this context that the CBI approached the High Court to strike out whatever cases were filed against them.\",\n",

What is Jaganmohan Reddy doing, who is repeatedly saying that the budget introduced by the center is good for Andhra Pradesh, what you are doing for Andhra Pradesh? There will be no struggle, no rebellion, and if anything is brought to the people, that means there will be no total annihilation. The entire state will be taken away and put in the hands of a person named Adani. The Telugu flag will be reparepalla at the international level. If it's over, now it's gone, it's going to be sold, it should be given, it's a breaking news, someone's friend is telling me, but nothing has been achieved, what means there will be anger, there will be words, there will be curses, there will be gossip, they will get everything, they are writing that something should come, something should come to Patti, something should come to the state. The harvest for Jaganmohan Reddy should be the harvest for the government, but not for Jaganmohan Reddy, not as a person. It is enough for us to take such things, but what is the Chief Minister doing when he goes to Delhi? The court ordered that the details of the fixed deposit of Bharatiya Cements were not given. The matter of the case is that his son-in-law, brother Sarath Chandra Reddy Chandra Reddy, has come on bail saying that Nanamma Garu has died in the liquor scam, but that liquor scam is getting stronger day by day. She said that all the flights used by them, all the bills are going to her, why are they giving it to the central government to these airlines?That's the way Sarath Chandra Reddy was correct until now, the day they released the first charge sheet, Vijay Sai Reddy's phone was not found. The situation is that he thinks that he will leave the cases, his own cases plus these are Gananda Reddy's case, there is a slight danger in the form of invincibility, he is the accused in the liquor case, but now it doesn't seem like there will be any political differences because if there are any political differences, they will be settled a little, but in the BJP culture, scandals are made after scandals and murders.

       " 'What is the sign of Jagan Mohan Reddy killing a Dalit child next to your house? What is the sign of the police headquarters being far away? What is the delay in taking place as the Chief Minister of this state? Virangam, the encouragement of your leaders, from all of them, these are the reasons for these murders, Jaganmohan Reddy, are you not? In these deaths, every criminal thinks that I am their leader.

MLC Kalvakuntla Kavitha's effigy of Karodali Nani Dishti was burnt, after which a complaint was lodged at Devarapalli police station. A large-scale fire broke out in a bike electrical show room near Secunderabad railway station. It is feared that the fire spread to the lathi.

In Chilakaluripet's Route Dinment Diet Men Colony, a dispute between a couple led to a murder. A wife was stabbed to death by her husband.

The opponents of YCP MLC Iqbal PA Gopi Krishna are behind the brutal murder of Ramakrishna Reddy in Chauluru, Hindupuram Rural.

       " 'Are MLAs getting new problems now? Are they insecure about whether they will get a ticket in the next election? Are they not able to guarantee the ticket even to their relatives? Has the voice of the two ministers in the district decreased in the meantime? Are there some mistakes? Are they confused as to who has the least tickets? In the last seven assembly elections in Narasa Raopet Parliament of Palladu district, the sitting Lorestiya has occupied the seat. The YCP MLAs who have won the seats are now facing new problems, which is causing some MLAs to sleep at least at night. In the last minute, after getting the YCP ticket in Chilakaluripet, she won and was elected as MLA. Leaders of Dwiya Srini want to hear that in the next election Rajini is planning to field Rajini from Guntur or from another place. The leadership is considering the names. In the three and a half years since the open tag was made mandatory in the last election in Palnadu district, there have been consequences such as TDP workers being brutally murdered like no other place in the state. There are criticisms that recently the leaders of their own party have fallen on the road in the case of Dhagaepalli.It is said that in the same party, three or four of them have been seen in his own social group. In Tac constituency, the whole list of corruption allegations against Srinivasa Reddy is coming. Some of the Reddy social group leaders have started a campaign saying that the three Nalu Rao will come and transfer him to another place in the election. Still, there are whispers that the YCP chief leaders are saying that the performance of some MLAs is not good at all and that they should improve it.',\n",
       " \"CBI increased aggressiveness in YS Vivekaharathi case CBI has issued notices to MP Avinash Reddy for the second time and told him to come for investigation on 24th of this month at 3 pm. They investigated the calls made by Avinashreddy. The charges were that evidence was destroyed at the scene of Viveka's murder. If Avanashreddy's role is found, there are chances of arrest. Two hundred witnesses have already registered the names of the suspects. Bhaskar Reddy also came to know on TV. TV has mentioned in the notices because people above the age of sixty years are required to give notices with prestat for twelve years. In this context CBI giving notices to Avinashred for the second time and giving notices to his father YS Paskar Reddy has created a sensation but recently last month it can be said that TV has increased the popularity of twenty-eight years. The trial of the case has already started in the CBI court in Hyderabad in the Nampally TV court, so the accused who are in the Kadapa jail have been sent to Hyderabad.\",\n",
       " \"And you all know the second complaint is that after Telangana state came, Chandrasekhar Rao changed democracy as a toy in the bazaar and it was found that from Sarpanch subsarpanch wati member to parliament member, FIR number four hundred and fifty five public two thousand and twenty two was registered in Moinabad police station regarding the purchase of MLAs. After listening to the complaints filed by the wards in the High Court, the High Court ordered that the CBI should be investigated. Not only did they murder the democracy, but they also opened the door to buying and selling. The four who are accused today are first-time offenders with criminal tendencies. Twelve MLAs have been included in TRS and if the Moinabad police go to file a complaint regarding them, they will not be able to set it up there and they will investigate it, that's why the Congress party has complained to the Moinabad police to the state DGP. On Saturday, the Congress party asked Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar for an appointment, but his office did not give an appointment today. The health of the Chief Secretary has not been good since three days. We don't know when he will come. The MLAs and all the other leaders also have an appointment.Think about how irresponsible the Chief Secretary is acting. Today Mr. Chief Sakrat did not give the Secpoint. This is correct. Chief Sakrat. The Congress Party will demand to transfer all these details to the CBI, written by the CPI, which you will bring officially, if the State DGP of Moinabad Police will act as the Chief of the State. We demand that action be taken against the criminals involved in the Adu Nagar Kurnool crime. The second complaint is that the full details of the twelve legislators who defected from the party should be provided to the CBI and the pest of these defectors.\",\n",
       " \"BJP's AP State Vice President Vishnukumar Raju expressed his anger over CM Jagan's picketing of women in Narasapuram Sabha. I wonder if Women's Commission Chairperson Vasireddy Padma doesn't see it as wrong if women are treated so badly. Jaganmohan Reddy must also answer all of them because that is what the mechanism has done, but not personally, it will create a situation where the chairman will have to bow his head with shame. In this state, Jaganmohan Reddy may not know this. You should know that the leaders of the opposition party have called and asked about us. I don't think I have seen that everything is cost payment in Liquor and now seats are being announced since last year YSRCP has announced seat for Kandy et in our constituency I am happy if there is a Babu who listens to money because if he inquires the murder will come out and all these are ready to buy votes through village volunteers. Needless to say\"]"
